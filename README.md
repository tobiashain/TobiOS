# My Personal Website — Styled as an Operating System Interface

## Key Objectives

A comprehensive platform designed to showcase technical expertise, act as a professional portfolio, demonstrate advanced UI/UX capabilities, and reflect personal interests — all within a custom-built React application that mimics the look and feel of a desktop operating system.
